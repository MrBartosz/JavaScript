The prime numbers are not regularly spaced. For example from 2 to 3 the gap is 1. From 3 to 5 the gap is 2. From 7 to 11 it is 4. Between 2 and 50 we have the following pairs of 2-gaps primes: 3-5, 5-7, 11-13, 17-19, 29-31, 41-43

Examples:
- gap(2, 5, 7) --> [5, 7] or (5, 7) or {5, 7}
- gap(4, 130, 200) --> [163, 167] or (163, 167) or {163, 167}
- gap(6,100,110) --> nil or {0, 0} or ... : between 100 and 110 we have 101, 103, 107, 109 but 101-107is not a 6-gap because there is 103in between and 103-109is not a 6-gap because there is 107in between.

Your function should return the first pair of two prime numbers spaced with a gap of g between the limits m, n if these numbers exist otherwise NULL
